Original text: "The goal of this project is to create a simple interupt driven library for generating composite video on a single AVR chip. Currently the output is NTSC or PAL at a resolution of 128x96 by default. The library currently works on ATmega 168, 328, 1280, 2560, 644p, 1284p and AT90USB1286 and more can be added by editing one file."

There are some timing issues with the m1284p, may be related to sanguino core.

You can add your design here if you also have a disign for the TVout project.
